This modification is aimed at lowing the graphics settings as much as possible while keeping the <ins>competitive integrity</ins> for ranked play. It aims to update as *little as possible* and only when necessary. If you have any suggestions or concerns about this to help improve the config for this idea, please join the [OptiLock Discord](https://discord.gg/hkmmVHnVVT).

# Base Instructions
To install the performance config replace the gameinfo.gi with ours in ``steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel``.
To change your video.txt follow the instructions in the provided video.txt file in this mod. Your video.txt file is located at ``steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel/cfg/video.txt``.
You *MUST* install both or else you will have a very weird looking game.
**There is a video tutorial** for installation avaliable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsycAaJlCRM).

[*Your video.txt file should look like this, minus your resolution and refresh rate changes.*](https://ibb.co/NG5sZ9T) 

**YOU MUST MAKE VIDEO.TXT READONLY AFTERWARDS OR THE GAME MAY RESET IT. THIS WILL ALSO CAUSE ANY CHANGES SET IN GAME NOT TO STICK AFTER RESTART SO YOU WILL HAVE TO SET THE CORRESPONDING COMMAND MANUALLY IN THE FILE YOURSELF.**

**IF YOU RAISE YOUR setting.r_texture_stream_mip_bias past 4, YOU WILL HAVE TO INSTALL THE SINNER'S LIGHT FIX MOD. THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL ADDONS FOLDER.**

# Optional Optimizations

[Windows and Linux Optimization Project](https://github.com/dacooderr/Windows-and-Linux-Optimization)

**<ins>Improve 1% lows</ins>**: Using RTSS and locking your fps in-game to 3 fps under your refresh rate and turning on Vsync + Gsync (Or AMD Freesync/Intel Adaptive-Sync) can significantly improve your 1% lows.
[Download Here](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download/).

**<ins>Process Lasso</ins>**: 
Using this in conjunction with everything can further improve 1% lows by giving Deadlock high priority and messing with the CPU affinity according to your Processor.
[Download Here](https://bitsum.com/).

You can find a tutorial on how to utilize Process Lasso [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXpnCqXxwz8).

# Pretty Important Announcement
Valve has started restricting certain convars, as of late March. The config still works for now and Valve is aware of this config and is aware of the need for this. So only time will tell.

# Table
Here is a list of each config provided in this repository.
| Config File                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                                              |

| [kaizuchaneru's minimum spec](https://github.com/dacooderr/OptiLock/blob/main/kaizuchaneru's%20minimum%20spec/gameinfo.gi) | This config prioritizes fps above all else and dramatically reduces graphical quality. Recommended for bad computers      |

# FAQ
- "How do I find a value in the config"  
Press ctrl+f in your text editor and type in the string you want.  
- "How do I restore a value to default"  
Comment it out.  
- "What does commenting mean"  
to comment a line put ``//`` at the front of the line. It will make it not executed by the config.  
- "Why are my characters dark in the portraits on the end screen and shop"  
``r_directlighting`` set it to ``true``.   
- "How do I change my fov"

  ``r_aspectratio``
  ``citadel_camera_hero_fov``
    + Adjust these two values to your liking.  

- "The config broke this patch"  
The gameinfo.gi gets overwritten every major update. You need to manually replace it again.  

- "I can't see trooper healthbars and boxes past a certain distance"  
``r_size_cull_threshold "0.7"``  comment this out.
