# Base Instructions
To install the performance config replace the gameinfo.gi in ``steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel`` with the one downloaded from this repository. Instructions for video.txt are in the video.txt file.
**There is a video tutorial** for installation avaliable [here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyJP3u-Y60)

# Optional Optimizations

Improve 1% lows: Using RTSS and locking your fps in-game to 3 fps under your refresh rate and turning on Vsync + Gsync (Or AMD Freesync/Intel Adaptive-Sync) can significantly improve your 1% lows.

Process Lasso: 
Using this in conjunction with everything can further improve 1% lows by giving Deadlock high priority and messing with the CPU affinity according to your Processor.

# Pretty Important Announcement
Valve has started restricting certain convars, as of late March. The config still works for now and Valve is aware of this config and is aware of the need for this. So only time will tell.

# Table
Here is a list of each config provided in this repository.
| Config File                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [OptiLock default](https://github.com/dacooderr/OptiLock-/blob/main/gameinfo.gi)                                    | Performance oriented config with the intent of competitive use.                                                    |
| [kaizuchaneru's minimum spec](https://github.com/dacooderr/OptiLock-/blob/main/kaizuchaneru's%20minimum%20spec/gameinfo.gi) | This config prioritizes fps above all else and dramatically reduces graphical quality. Recommended for bad computers |
| [Piggy's gameinfo.gi](https://github.com/dacooderr/OptiLock-/tree/main/piggy's%20config)                                    | Base optimizations but is here for if you want to use his config                                                     |
| [cvarlist.md](https://github.com/dacooderr/OptiLock-/blob/main/cvarlist.md)                                                 | Every single convar in the game's code. Not a proper config but instead a reference.                                 |


# FAQ
- "How do I find a value in the config"  
Press ctrl+f in your text editor and type in the string you want.  
- "How do I restore a value to default"  
Comment it out.  
- "What does commenting mean"  
to comment a line put ``//`` at the front of the line. It will make it not executed by the config.  
- "Why are my characters dark in the portraits on the end screen and shop"  
``r_directlighting`` set it to ``true``.   
- "How do I change my fov"

``r_aspectratio``
``citadel_camera_hero_fov``

Adjust these two values to your liking.  

- "The config broke this patch"  
The gameinfo.gi gets overwritten every major update. You need to manually replace it again.  

- "I can't see trooper healthbars and boxes past a certain distance"  
``r_size_cull_threshold "0.7"``  comment this out.
